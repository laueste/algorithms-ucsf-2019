# test functions for the neural network class
from nn import utils
import pytest

# test overall structure (aka that weight arrays are the right dimensions)

# for a static set of starting weights, input, and output, test that the
# calculation of the errors in the first round of learning is as we expect


# ... what else do we test about an NN?
