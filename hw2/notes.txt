similarity metric thoughts

so trying to reimplement PARIS would be a little nuts
I would like to have a similarity matrix that takes into account/has some
relation to the chemical environment of the binding pocket, more than
evolutionarily conserved structure and stuff

- raw volume is a good metric for making large-scale discriminations (see PARIS)
- could do a classification of amino acids into chemistry groups,
and then decide on a weighting somehow (ML?) of location vs similarity of
chemical properties for atoms nearby?
- I like the PARIS paper's use of gaussians and overall closeness ish rather
than counting overlapping atoms


Okay, so general strategies
- so, is there a way to get charge out of the pdb? like, on an atom scale,
sometimes its the carbons that are relevant, sometimes the O's and sometimes
the N's
- on the amino acid scale we can make broad strokes categorizations



Things I want to take into account:
- the 3D shape in space of the active site
- the temperature/uncertainty value of each atom
- the  electronegativity/chemical properties of atom/immediate environment


One way to do this would be to make a 5-element vector with x,y,z, b-factor,
and pka (and also charge?) for each atom based on like, standard info (ignoring
interactions with local atoms)

uncertainty would have to be used to somehow scale the weight/stringency on
the xyz location...?

maybe also the atom itself (N, O, C etc.)

what distance metric makes sense? euclidean? any sort of spatial dilation?

OKAY FOR REAL NOW

Not a lot of time, what simple yet hopefully somewhat theoretically sound
clustering metrics can we use?

I want to combine three metrics:

1) dimensionality information
- get difference between max(x for all atoms for all residues) and min(x for
all atoms for all residues) for each of x,y,z for a total spanning distance
- get N residues
- get ratio of span and length

2) circular-aware sequence alignment
- duplicate one of the sequences to remove origin issues
(- ideally we could break this into residue cluster similarities rather than
exact sequence alignment but oh well.)

3) residue composition
- list of list of floats representing percent amino acids in each "group"
- [ [nonpolar],[cys],[[polar],[pos],[neg]],[gly,pro]]
- e.g. [ [40.9],[0.05],[[23],[16],[10]],[0.02,0.03]
